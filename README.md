## GStreamerSwiftUIDemo

A demo app that uses gstreamer with a SwiftUI interface to display a local RTSP feed.

**Note**: Before building the app, change the RTSP address [here](https://github.com/borarak/GStreamerSwiftUIDemo/blob/9d257a84243bd4c9063f1909020eae028bf3a319/GStreamerSwiftUIDemo/GStreamerBackend.m#L163) to a valid one.

**Note 2**: Before compiling to an actual device, make sure that you removed "arm64" from the Excluded Architecture in the Build Settings
